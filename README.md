 # **Guidelines:**

 
 Create a dynamic dashboard that provides the following insights:
 
 ● Total sales revenue: Calculate the total revenue generated by the company based on the "Total" column.
 
 ● Monthly sales trend: Create an appropriate chart that shows the monthly sales trend over a given period. The chart should display the total sales revenue for each month.
 
 ● Top-selling products: Determine the top 5 best-selling products based on the total quantity sold. Display the product line under which they are present and quantities in a separate table.
 
 ● Customer analysis: Create a bar chart that shows the distribution of customers based on the total amount they spent. Group customers into different spending ranges (e.g., $0-$100, $101-$500, $501-$1000, etc.)
   and display the number of customers in each range.

 ● Sales by branch: Analyse the sales performance by branch. Calculate the total sales revenue for each branch and display the results in a pie chart.
 
 ● Sales by customer type: Create a PivotTable that summarizes the total sales revenue for each customer type.
 
 Note: The dataset may contain thousands of rows, Use appropriate Excel functions, formulas, and techniques to handle the data efficiently and ensure that the dashboard updates automatically when the dataset
 changes.
